# Before You Run

Before You Run is a developer-safety information project for beginner and indie developers.

Previous provisional name: Tripwire.

The project focuses on public-safe risky-action cards: what to avoid, what to check first, safer alternatives, source links, and AI/agent safety prompts for development workflows.

## Current status

Current phase: v0.1 MVP release preparation.

The repository currently includes the v0.1 static site foundation, data-driven risky-action cards, search/filter/detail behavior, AI/agent copy actions, utility pages, license files, and JSON validation.

The public MVP specification is available at:

```text
docs/specs/tripwire-mvp-spec-v0.1.md
```

## v0.1 scope

The v0.1 MVP provides:

```text
- English root page
- Japanese /ja/ page
- Risky-action card list
- Card detail view
- Category pages
- AI safety rules page
- Search and filters
- Source URL display
- Source type display
- AI / Agent Safety copy actions
- Checklists
- Command safety reference
- After-incident guide
- Sources page
- Mobile-readable layout
- JSON data validation
```

## Public content boundary

Before You Run is defensive and educational. Public content should focus on:

```text
- Risk categories
- Beginner-safe explanations
- What to avoid
- Safer alternatives
- Source links
- Confidence / freshness / severity labels
- Public-safe summaries
```

Before You Run should not publish offensive operational detail, unverified claims as facts, or private planning notes.

## AI-output workflow

Before You Run includes local AI-output workflows for defensive safety packs, downloadable AI rules, assistant bundle examples, and AI-output validation.

See:

- `docs/runbooks/ai-output-index.md`

Main commands:

```bash
npm run packs:report
npm run rules:build
npm run bundles:build
npm run ai-output:validate
```

These workflows are local and do not use AI, fetch sources, publish cards, or modify `data/threats.json` automatically.


## Local operator workflow

Before You Run supports a local manual operator workflow for real review data.

```bash
npm run operator:setup
npm run operator:run
```

`operator:setup` creates ignored local working files from tracked templates.

`operator:run` runs the local review reports against those local files.

Local operator files are not committed by default:

```text
data/*.local.json
reports/*.local.md
```

This workflow does not fetch sources, use social APIs, run AI, process screenshots, publish cards, or modify `data/threats.json` automatically.

## One-item local workflow walkthrough

A tracked one-item walkthrough is available to demonstrate the local review flow without using real claims or private data.

Command: npm run walkthrough:run

This runs the local review pipeline against safe placeholder walkthrough data and writes ignored local walkthrough reports. It does not modify public card data or publish cards.
## Downloadable AI rules

Reviewed category safety packs can be exported locally as Markdown AI rule files.

```bash
npm run rules:build
```

This reads local reviewed safety pack examples and writes Markdown rule files plus a manifest. It does not use AI, fetch sources, modify cards, or publish anything automatically.

## Assistant bundles

Reviewed downloadable AI rules can be combined into local assistant bundle examples.

```bash
npm run bundles:build
```

This writes AGENTS.example.md, cursor-rules.example.md, a manifest, and a report. It does not use AI, fetch sources, install editor config, or publish anything automatically.


## AI-output validation report

A local AI-output validation report is available for reviewing example assistant outputs.

```bash
npm run ai-output:validate
```

This reads local example output samples and writes a Markdown validation report. It does not call AI, fetch sources, generate text, or publish anything automatically.

## Sitemap and robots

The static sitemap and robots files can be regenerated locally without changing runtime UI behavior.

```bash
npm run sitemap:build
```

Use `SITE_URL` to generate the sitemap for a custom domain later:

```bash
SITE_URL="https://example.com" npm run sitemap:build
```

## Technical direction

The initial implementation is a static site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON data files. Candidate collection and advisory-source integrations are planned for later versions.

## Candidate source metadata

Before You Run includes public-safe source metadata for future candidate collection. Automated collection is not active in v0.1.


## Candidate digest skeleton

A local manual candidate digest builder is available for future v0.2 workflows.

```bash
npm run digest:build
```

This uses example candidate data and does not fetch external sources.

## Candidate review queue

A local review queue example is available for future v0.2 workflows.

```bash
npm run queue:digest
```

This generates a review digest from local example data only.


## Card draft pipeline

A local candidate-to-card draft builder is available for future v0.2 workflows.

```bash
npm run drafts:build
```

This creates draft card JSON and a Markdown report from local review queue example data. Drafts are not published automatically.




## Intake runner skeleton

A local no-network intake runner skeleton is available for future Phase 2 workflows.

```bash
npm run intake:run
```

This processes local example intake data only. It does not fetch RSS feeds or call external APIs.

## Manual intake format

Before You Run includes a local manual intake format for URLs, article notes, social links, screenshot references, and manual notes.

```bash
npm run intake:run
```

Manual intake data is local example data only and does not publish candidates or cards automatically.

## Candidate moderation report

A local candidate moderation report builder is available for Phase 2 review workflows.

```bash
npm run moderation:report
```

This reads local manual intake example data and writes a Markdown moderation report. It does not publish candidates or cards.


## Freshness / severity helper

A local freshness and severity helper report is available for Phase 2 review workflows.

```bash
npm run freshness:report
```

This reads local manual intake example data and writes a Markdown helper report. It does not verify truth, fetch sources, or publish candidates/cards.


## Duplicate detection

A local duplicate detection report is available for manual intake review.

```bash
npm run duplicates:report
```

This checks local manual intake data only and does not fetch external sources.


## Source credibility helper

A local source credibility helper report is available for Phase 2 review workflows.

```bash
npm run credibility:report
```

This reads local manual intake example data and writes a Markdown helper report. It does not verify truth, fetch sources, or publish candidates/cards.


## Card update history

A local card update history report is available for Phase 2 editorial workflows.

```bash
npm run history:report
```

This reads local example update history data and writes a Markdown report. It does not modify published cards automatically.


## Publish review workflow

A local publish review report is available for Phase 2 editorial workflows.

```bash
npm run publish:report
```

This reads local example publish review data and writes a Markdown report. It does not publish or modify cards automatically.

## Manual social signal ingestion

A local manual social signal report is available for Phase 3 workflows covering X, Bluesky, Mastodon, and other manually collected social signals.

```bash
npm run social:report
```

This reads local example social signal data and writes a Markdown report. It does not use social APIs, perform live fetches, scrape websites, or publish candidates/cards automatically. Social signals do not publish cards automatically.

## Screenshot / manual evidence flow

A local evidence report is available for screenshot references and manual evidence notes.

```bash
npm run evidence:report
```

This reads local example evidence data and writes a Markdown report. It does not process images, run OCR, fetch sources, or publish candidates/cards automatically.


## Signal verification queue

A local signal verification queue report is available for Phase 3 workflows.

```bash
npm run verify:report
```

This reads local example verification queue data and writes a Markdown report. It does not fetch sources, use social APIs, process images, or publish candidates/cards automatically.


## Category safety packs

A local category safety pack report is available for Phase 4 AI-facing defensive guidance workflows.

```bash
npm run packs:report
```

This reads local example safety pack data and writes a Markdown report. It does not use AI, fetch sources, publish cards, or generate downloadable bundles automatically.

## Signal labels
